# Chakshu_Rakshak
 AI based Computer Vision Image Clssification model distinguishing between the fundoscopic images of the retina suffering from Cataract and a normal retina.

* download the attached source code files (Chakshu_Rakshak.ipynb and Output.ipynb) along with the the dataset (find the link to the google drive folder in dataset folder)
* open Google Colab on your browser and login with your Google Account if not done already
* upload the given source code files onto Google Colab

    File>>>Upload Notebook>>>Select Chakshu_Rakshak.ipynb
    File>>>Upload Notebook>>>Select Output.ipynb

* run the entire code (Chakshu_Rakshak) 

    Runtime>>>Run All

* wait for the model to train

***Kindly retrain the model until you get an average
   accuracy of 80-90% (you can analyse that from the best accuracy graph)
   since the model effieciency varies in various training sessions***
   
* download the trained model
* upload trained_model.sav in the same folder (where the dataset has been stored)
* navigate to Output.ipynb and run the entire code

    Runtime>>>Run All

* upload the testing images to produce output

# Thanks
