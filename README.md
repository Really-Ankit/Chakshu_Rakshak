# Chakshu_Rakshak
 AI based Computer Vision Image Clssification model distinguishing between the fundoscopic images of the retina suffering from Cataract and a normal retina.

# download the attached source code file (Chakshu_Rakshak.ipynb) along with the testing images
# open Google Colab on your browser and login with your Google Account if not done already
# upload the given source code file onto Google Colab

    File>>>Upload Notebook>>>Select Chakshu_Rakshak.ipynb

# run the entire code 

    Runtime>>>Run All

# wait for the model to train

***Kindly retrain the model until you get an average
   accuracy of 80-90% (you can analyse that from the best accuracy graph)
   since the model effieciency varies in various training sessions
   
# upload the testing images in the last code bloack to test the output
# do read the entire document (Chakshu Rakshak) to get a better idea of the technical aspect of the code

((((Thanks))))
